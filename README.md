# 💧 Irrigation Regression Model

This project focuses on building a regression model to support decision-making in irrigation systems. Using machine learning techniques, the model predicts outcomes based on environmental or agricultural data relevant to irrigation management.

The implementation is done in a Jupyter Notebook and includes steps for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## 🏗️ Project Structure

1. **Introduction**
   - Objective: Develop a regression model for irrigation-related data
2. **Data Analysis**
   - Exploration of input features and target variable
   - Visualizations to understand relationships
3. **Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing and outlier values
   - Feature scaling and transformation
4. **Modeling**
   - Application of regression algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest)
   - Performance metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R²
5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Comparing model results
   - Plotting predictions vs. actual values
